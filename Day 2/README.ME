The directory structure separates roles, variables, and configurations.
Variables like packages and sites are defined in role defaults or vars for better organization.
Handlers are used for tasks that require notification triggers.
Templates (httpd.conf.j2, nginx.conf.j2 and auth.conf.j2) can be populated based on your specific Apache configuration and authentication needs.


Run the playbook:

ansible-playbook install_web_servers.yml -e @web_servers_variables.yml
